# cogenial-banking
This Deep Learning neural network tests and trains on 8000+ sample banking data reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.After tuning and immense training,we found out the appropriate hyperparameters for our model.
The obtained accuracy is around 85% which seems good enough when we look at the background its working with respect to.
It uses the Churn modelling dataset from kaggle-https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling
Thank You.
